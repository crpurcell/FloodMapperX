Welcome to the home of ML4Floods FloodMapper - a scalable AI pipeline
for rapidly mapping the extent of flood water in satellite imagery.

FloodMapper is based on the the open-source [ML4Floods
Toolkit](https://github.com/spaceml-org/ml4floods), originally
developed during the Frontier Development Lab
([FDL](https://fdleurope.org/)) Europe research program and later
enhanced using support from the UK Space Agency.

In this repository:
 * [scripts](scripts) ... Contains the core tasks for creating flood maps.
 * [tutorial](tutorial) ... End-to-end instructions on using FloodMapper.
 * [deploy_boulia](deploy_boulia) ... Minimal FloodMapper deployment example.
 * [resources](resources) ... Files used by the pipeline and tutorial.
 * [flood-activations](flood-activations) ... Local flooding event files.
